title: Apple's Liam sounds great, did you know about this other not so secret free ewaste recycling program?
---

Lots of excitment around the news of Liam, [Apple's super secret 29-armed robot that tears down your iPhone](http://mashable.com/2016/03/21/apple-liam-recycling-robot/#INiVAUbTHqqi). As an Apple product lover and shareholder I am thrilled with their continued environmental initiatives. 

While it's certainly not news, it seems uncommon knowledge that Apple will recycle up to 10 items of your e-waste TODAY "regardless of brand" for free. 
I know [NYC](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/electronics.shtml) and most major cities have recycling events a few times a year but this beats hauling your junk across the city and waiting on line.

"Apple contracts with Sims Recycling Solutions to responsibly recycle computers and displays from any manufacturer. Generate a prepaid shipping label by going to [www.applepoweredbysims.com](http://www.applepoweredbysims.com). Then pack up your equipment using your own box and send it off. For more information about Sims Recycling Solutions or questions about this program call 800-966-4135."

If you have some old electronics that can not be donated should check out this program.
