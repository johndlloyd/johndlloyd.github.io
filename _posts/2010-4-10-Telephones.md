“The telephone was an aberration in human development. It was a 70 year or so period where for **some reason humans decided it was socially acceptable to ring a loud bell in someone else’s life and they were expected to come running, like dogs**. This was the equivalent of thinking it was okay to walk into someone’s living room and start shouting. It was never okay." — [Rick Webb](http://rickwebb.tumblr.com/post/556400952/the-never-call-there-are-some-people-who-love-to)

Also keep in mind that Caller ID was only around for the last 20 of those years. Reminds me of why I love Google Voice so much. It is so nice to **MANAGE** your phone calls and voicemail
