title: On buying Apple Stock instead of Apple products
---

For years people have been writing [these types](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/if-you-bought-apple-stock-instead-of-products/) [of](http://www.businessinsider.com/had-you-invested-in-apple-stock-instead-2013-5) [posts](https://kyleconroy.com/apple-stock), having just sold my 7th Generation iPod Classic (160GB!) I figured I would run the numbers.

April 2008: I paid $349 (tax free as I was living in Oregon at the time).
March 2016: sold the same iPod on eBay for $268 and change after taxes, fees, and shipping costs.

**Cost of using an iPod Classic for 8 years $82**

Value of $349 worth of [AAPL](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=22144) purchased in April 2008 today based on the [buyupside](http://www.buyupside.com/stockreturncalculator/stockreturncalcresultsincludeform.php?symbol=AAPL&interval=m&start_month=03&start_day=21&start_year=2007&end_month=02&end_day=21&end_year=2016&submit=Calculate+Returns) $1,260.91!

A 360.26% return! Would have have held onto the stock to realize those gains? Fun to think about, but easier said then done.

The one thing for sure, 160 GB was overkill, I never even used half the capacity of device.
