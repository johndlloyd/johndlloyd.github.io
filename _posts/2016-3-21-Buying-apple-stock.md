title: On buying Apple Stock instead of Apple products
---

For years people have been writing [these types](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/if-you-bought-apple-stock-instead-of-products/) [of](http://www.businessinsider.com/had-you-invested-in-apple-stock-instead-2013-5) [posts](https://kyleconroy.com/apple-stock). Having just sold my 7th Generation iPod Classic (160 GB!) I figured I would run the numbers myself.

April 2008: I paid $349 (tax-free as I was living in Oregon at the time).
March 2016: I sold the same iPod on eBay netting $268 after fees and shipping costs.

**Cost of owning an iPod Classic for 8 years $82**

Value of $349 worth of [AAPL](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=22144) purchased in April 2008 today based on [buyupside](http://www.buyupside.com/stockreturncalculator/stockreturncalcresultsincludeform.php?symbol=AAPL&interval=m&start_month=03&start_day=21&start_year=2007&end_month=02&end_day=21&end_year=2016&submit=Calculate+Returns) data **$1,260.91**!

A 360.26% return! Would I have held the stock long enough to realize those gains? Fun to think about, but easier said then done.

The one thing for sure, the 160 GB was overkill, I never even used half the capacity the iPod.
