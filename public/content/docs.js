I am a Product Manager who loves technology and building useful products.

## Career Summary
I have spent my career working across strategy, discovery, delivery, and post-launch iteration. Most of my work has been in fintech, where trust and reliability matter as much as speed.

I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to move from rough ideas to clear decisions and shipped outcomes. I care most about work that is useful, measurable, and durable.
