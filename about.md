Hi I am John D. Lloyd! I live and work in New York City.

By day I enjoy building hardware and software products for mission driven organizations. By night I spend my time reading, taking pictures, and dreaming about my next adventure.

I get excited about good bbq, premium dairy products, fresh air, and bikes!
